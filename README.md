# Tetris_Game
A simple MFC tetris game with VS2019
***
It's my progamming task in C progamming class in HUST. So it may seem not very good.\
In `SingleGame.cpp`, you can play the game youself and it also have easy, medium,  hard and crazy mode. Moreover, you can stop the game and stop the music all the time.\
In `MultiGame.cpp`, you can play it with your friend in one computer. But it also have some problems you should find. This part hasn't been completed yet because of both the limit of time and the capibility of mine.
***
This task was limited to use MFC platform. And you'd better program your game with QT since we can use it on windows, macos, linux and so on.
